## Features

CliniCord is a Discord bot written using the [interactions-py](https://github.com/interactions-py/interactions.py) library that provides validated health and risk assessments for Discord users concerned about their health.

## Disclaimer

This bot is intended to only provide a limited initial assessment of a user's health status. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, nor is it a telehealth consulting tool. The bot will remind users of this following all assessments and even provide free resources to get help.
